CLIQUE TV is a pioneering streaming service that first launched in 2000 and began streaming content publicly in 2005, making it one of the first platforms of its kind—predating major competitors like YouTube. In 2006, Google made a $60,000 buyout offer, which was turned down by founder Lyndal Spirit. Now, CLIQUE TV is undergoing a major redevelopment to re-enter the market with innovative features and a fresh user experience.

History & Evolution

2000: Founded as a digital streaming concept, initially hosting independent media.

2005: Public streaming service launched, allowing creators to share and monetize their content.

2006: Google’s buyout offer was declined, reinforcing CLIQUE TV’s independence.

2025: Relaunch and redevelopment efforts initiated to modernize the platform with new technology and advanced user experiences.

Current Development Efforts
The new CLIQUE TV platform is being designed to compete with contemporary streaming giants while maintaining its unique identity as a community-driven, creator-first service. The following are key areas of focus:

User Experience & Interface:

Modern, sleek UI with intuitive navigation.

Personalization features driven by AI to recommend content.

Dark mode and accessibility enhancements.

Content & Monetization Model:

Multi-tier subscription options (ad-supported, premium, creator revenue-sharing model).

Direct monetization for independent creators via tips, pay-per-view, and exclusive content access.

High-quality streaming with adaptive bitrate technology.

A monetization model that allocates almost 30% of earnings to creators.

Technological Infrastructure:

Blockchain integration for transparent creator payments and copyright protection.

Mobile and Smart TV app support for cross-device accessibility.

Community & Social Features:

Interactive live streaming with audience engagement tools.

Integrated social media sharing and community discussions.

Exclusive member content and creator collaborations.

Inspiration from Bigo App
Please review the Bigo app as a reference point. Bigo has strong engagement and monetization features that could be pivotal in shaping CLIQUE TV’s new direction. The new CLIQUE TV should incorporate many of Bigo’s successful features while making significant improvements to redefine the future of streaming. Our goal is to surpass their performance metrics and revenue model.

Built-in AI for Content Creation
CLIQUE TV will integrate an advanced AI-powered content creation suite that allows creators to complete their entire production process within the app. This will eliminate the need for third-party tools and keep users engaged on the platform from start to finish.

Development Partnership & 5-Year Buyout Plan
To ensure CLIQUE TV achieves its vision and surpasses the financial success of the Bigo app, a strategic development partnership will be established with a structured 5-year buyout agreement. The terms of the partnership include:

The development company will design and build a cutting-edge platform that exceeds Bigo’s financial and engagement metrics.

CLIQUE TV will grant a percentage-based revenue share during the first five years to incentivize performance-based development.

If the platform successfully surpasses Bigo’s financial benchmarks within the 5-year timeframe, CLIQUE TV will execute a buyout of the development company’s stake, ensuring a profitable exit for all parties.

Milestone-based payouts and bonuses will be incorporated to ensure continued innovation and high-quality delivery.

The development company will retain an advisory role post-buyout to assist with further innovation and scaling efforts.

Vision for the Future
The goal is to position CLIQUE TV as a hybrid platform that blends the best features of streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, and Patreon while maintaining a unique identity. The new development should prioritize:

A creator-centric economy where independent media thrives.

Advanced AI-driven content discovery.

Robust security and copyright protection.

Seamless integration across devices for a frictionless viewing experience.

Next Steps for the Development Team

Establish the core platform infrastructure and finalize tech stack.

Develop and test key user features, including streaming, payments, and interactive elements.

Implement a phased launch strategy with beta testing before public rollout.

Optimize monetization strategies and build partnerships with content creators.

Structure the development partnership agreement with performance-based incentives."
